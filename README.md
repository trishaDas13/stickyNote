<h2>ðŸš©JavaScript code description: </h2>
This JavaScript code is designed to create and manage notes with a specified background color on a web page. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:
1.	It selects various elements on the web page and stores them in variables:
â€¢	addNote: Represents a button element.
â€¢	notesContainer: Represents a container for displaying notes.
â€¢	textArea: Represents a textarea element where the user can enter note content.
â€¢	heading: Represents a heading element.
â€¢	color: Represents an input element where the user can choose a background color for the notes.
2.	It adds an event listener to the "addNote" button (addNote) for the "click" event.
3.	Inside the "click" event listener, it retrieves the content from the textArea and stores it in the text variable.
4.	It checks if the text variable is empty. If it is, it prevents the default behavior of the button click (which would be form submission) and displays an alert, prompting the user to add text.
5.	If the text is not empty, it creates a new div element (notes) to represent the note. It sets the content of the note as the text from the textArea. It also includes a "Delete" button within the note.
6.	It appends the new note (notes) to the notesContainer.
7.	It sets the background color of both the p elements (text content) and the div elements (notes) to the selected color from the color input.
8.	It clears the content of the textArea by setting its value to an empty string.
9.	It adds another event listener to each "Delete" button within the notes. When a "Delete" button is clicked, it removes the parent div containing the note from the notesContainer.
